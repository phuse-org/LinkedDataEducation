# Study URI
This is a working draft for developing a guide to creating Uniforml Resource 
Identifiers (URIs) for clinical studies/trials. The work was inspired by the 
PhUSE EUConnect18 paper "Study URI" [[Paper]](http://www.phusewiki.org/docs/Frankfut%20Connect%202018/TT/Papers/TT10-tt09-study-uri-19746.pdf) [[Presentation]](http://www.phusewiki.org/docs/Frankfut%20Connect%202018/TT/Presentations/TT10-tt09-study-uri-pub-19747.pdf) by Kerstin Forsberg
and Daniel Goude, with follow up discussions including Johannes Ulander and 
Tim Williams. These recommendations are under development and subject to change.

## Background
[KF or DG: PLEASE ADD CONTENT HERE,  some of which can come from your paper. Use generic terms to describe why a URI is needed]

## Proposed Structure
A Study URI is comprised of three components. The Global Namespace, Resource Type, and Trial ID.

https://data.pharma.abc/clinicaltrial/D3562C00096

[URI ABOVE WILL  BE REPLACED WITH AN IMAGE]

**1. Global Namespace**  `https://data.pharma.abc`

[DESCRIBE HOW TO SPECIFY, IMPLICATIONS FOR DEREFERENCING]

**2. Resource type**  `clinicaltrial`

[EXPLAIN CHOICE AND ONTOLOGY CONSIDERATION]

**3. Trial ID**   `D3562C00096`

The first choice for the Trial ID component is the NCT ID from ClinicalTrials.gov.  

Choice 1: Is the clinical trials.gov ID available for the drug?

 [ADD LINK AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIND OUT]  

Choice 2: A combo of internal ID's [?  ADD RECOMMENDATIONS]

Choice 3: [??]

[FLOWCHART WILL BE ADDED]
